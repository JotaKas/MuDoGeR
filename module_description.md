# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EACH MODULE

## Viral module
The viral module utilizes three viral recovery tools(**VirFinder**, **VirFinder**, **VIBRANT**) for identification and recovery of viral genomes from the assemble metagenomic data. In the beginning, the three tools are used to recover independently the viral genomes from a given assembly dataset and locates them in seperate folders.  In the next step the recovered sequences are filtered. The selection of proper VirFinder sequences is based on q-value =< 0.01 and lentgh >= 1000 bp, the VirFinder chosen sequences are those classified into categories 1 and 2 and from VIBRANT the selected sequences are contained in the "Assembly.phages_combined.fna" file. The headers of the filtered sequences are combined to a common fasta.file and the repeated headers are removed. In the next step, using the headers including in the common fasta.file to extract the actual sequences from the assembly dataset and are transfered to a new fasta.file. Finally, the viral module the duplicated contigs are removed by a de-replication process. The dependencies of the final are maximum coverage (-c 70) and maximum identity (-i 95). The final output results, are depositet to a new output folder, contained inside the output directory.
